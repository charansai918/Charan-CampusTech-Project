    <div className='header-theory'>
      <p> <strong id='strong1-theory'> Preparation:</strong>

Gather all the required materials and tools.
Draw a detailed circuit diagram indicating the positions of switches, plugs, and holders.</p>
<p><strong id='strong2-theory'>Cutting and Fixing Battens:</strong>

Use the tenon saw to cut the T.W battens to the required lengths.
Fix the battens to the walls using hink clips and wood screws. Ensure the battens are level and securely attached.</p>
<p><strong id='strong3-theory'>Laying the Wires:</strong>

Lay the CTS/T.R.S wire along the fixed battens, securing them with clips. Ensure the wires are of the correct gauge and can handle the required voltage.
Run the wires from the meter to the DPIC switch, then to the neutral link of the fuse, and finally to the switchboards in various rooms.</p>
<p><strong id='strong4-theory'>Installing Switches and Holders:</strong>

Install the batten holders, plugs, and tumbler switches at the designated points on the battens.
Secure these components with screws and connect the wires according to the circuit diagram.</p>
<p><strong id='strong5-theory'>Connecting to Power Supply:</strong>

Connect the supply terminals to the meter, then to the DPIC switch. One end of the supply should be connected to the neutral link of the fuse.
Connect the wires from the fuse to the switchboards in different rooms.</p>
<p><strong id='strong6-theory'>Testing the Circuit:</strong>

Once all connections are made, test the circuit to ensure proper functionality.
Use a multimeter to check for continuity and correct voltage levels.
Ensure there are no loose connections or potential short circuits.</p>
